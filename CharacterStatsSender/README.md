# Client

## Description

The client part is implemented as a small Unity application, and all the code is written in the C# programming language.  

The client currently consists of a window with registration and authorization, a window for creating a character,
and a window for viewing information about the created character. Of course, in addition to the visual layer,
there is also a layer of code responsible for sending and receiving messages from the server that stores and processes data.
